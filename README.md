# My-BMI-Calculator
This project is a simple BMI calculator implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It allows users to input their weight (kg or lbs) and height (in or cm) and calculates their BMI, then classifies it according to standard health categories.

## Project Objectives
- Practice using Python for simple mathematical calculations.
- Build an interactive program that takes user input.
- Help users easily understand their BMI status and gain advice respective to their status.

*Side-note: My motivation for this project came from my brother and me looking for a reliable BMI calculator online. We noticed that many websites are confusing or donâ€™t support the unit options we needed, so I decided to make one myself, since we need to track our body for our health goals.*

## My Process
- I made a pseudocode first on what I wanted the output to be.
- Started by defining the formula for BMI using online resources.
- Implemented conditional statements to classify BMI into underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.
- Provided general health advice based on the BMI category.
- Tested with different example values to ensure accuracy.

## Future Iteration
I plan to:
- Improve the UI to make it look more like a calculator (possibly using a graphical interface with Tkinter or Streamlit).
- Add more units (e.g. ft, grams)
